# Version Statements
# Issue: use v5.40 and similar version statements are not being parsed
# In Perl: use v5.40 declares the minimum Perl version required

# Version with 'v' prefix
use v5.40;

# Version without 'v' prefix (also valid)
use 5.040;

# Version with feature bundle
use v5.38;

# Code after version statement
my $x = 10;
