# Hash Autoquoting
# Issue: Barewords before => should be treated as strings, not identifiers
# In Perl: foo => 1 is equivalent to "foo" => 1

# Simple hash with autoquoted keys
my %hash = (
    foo => 1,
    bar => 2
);

# Hash with mixed key types
my %mixed = (
    auto => 1,        # autoquoted
    "quoted" => 2,    # explicitly quoted
    123 => 3          # numeric key
);

# Nested hash with autoquoting
my %nested = (
    outer => {
        inner => 42
    }
);
